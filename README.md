# Quick start

## Adding dependency

We use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) for the distribution of binaries

### Gradle

1. Add to `build.gradle` at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        //...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

2. Add the dependency
```groovy
//...
implementation 'com.github.yottapay:sdk-payment:v1.0.1'
```

### Maven

1. Add to the `pom.xml` repository
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. Add the dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.yottapay</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk-payment</artifactId>
    <version>v1.0.1</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

### Creating client

It’s better to use the client as a Singleton

```
YpSdkPayment sdkPayment = YpSdkPayment.createDefault(merchantId, merchantSecret);
```

If you want to use a sandbox environment:
```
YpSdkPaymentConfiguration configuration = YpSdkPaymentConfiguration.createDefault();

configuration.setMerchantIdentity(merchantId);
configuration.setSecret(merchantSecret);
configuration.setServerBaseUrl("https://sandbox.yottapay.co.uk/launcher"); //Important! No trailing slash

YpSdkPayment sdkPayment = YpSdkPayment.createFromConfiguration(configuration);

```

### Creating orders for processing
```
String myTransactionId = "123"; // your custom transaction id

YpPaymentCreation payment = YpPaymentCreation.builder()
 .merchantTransactionId(myTransactionId)
 .customerId("customerId") // your customer ID
 .amount("12.45") // order amount
 .currency("GBP") // always GBP
 .notificationId("") // always set to empty string and not null
 .urlPaymentResult("https://api.mysite.org/" + myTransactionId) // webhook address
 .urlPaymentSuccess("https://mysite.org/success/" + myTransactionId) // user will be redirected here after payment completed successfully
 .urlPaymentCancel("https://mysite.org/failed/" + myTransactionId) // user will be redirected here after payment failed
 .build();
YpPaymentCreationResult result = sdkPayment.createPayment(payment);
        // redirect user to result.getUrlProcessPaymentIntent()
```

The returned object (`YpPaymentCreationResult`) consists of two fields:
`urlProcessPaymentIntent`,which is the payment URL that you redirect the user to
`yottaTransactionId`, which is our transaction ID for the payment.

Please notice that `currency` is restricted to `GBP`. `notificationId` is reserved and should be set to empty string and be not null.

### Handling webhooks

Webhooks are used to inform you that payment status has been changed.

We will send you a `POST` request to the URL you specified in `urlPaymentResult` during order creation.
The callback body looks like this:
```json
{
  "yottapay_transaction_identifier": "YPR-123",
  "shop_transaction_identifier": "123",
  "merchant_identifier": "your_id",
  "customer_identifier": "customer_id",
  "amount": "12.45",
  "currency": "GBP",
  "response_code": "0",
  "signature": "string",
  "type": "statuschange"
}
```

The following JSON body can be deserialized to `YpPaymentExecutionStatusChangedRequest` POJO.

You **MUST** validate the request's signature using `YpSdkPayment#checkSignature` method. It will return `false` if signature has failed.

`response_code` states the payment processing result. If isn't `"0"` the payment should be treated as `FAILED`
